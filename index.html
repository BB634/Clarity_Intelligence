      <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
      <p>Your child’s safety is priceless.

      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>We are a dedicated team of former FBI agents, attorneys, and police officers with deep roots in Asia and a profound understanding of its cultures and customs. Fluent in Chinese and Korean, we bring not only language proficiency but cultural insight to every case. Many of us are parents ourselves, with children who have attended international schools — we understand your concerns because we've lived them.</p>

  <h2>Why Choose Us</h2>
  <p>We are parents ourselves — with children who have attended international schools and gone on to study in the United States. Through countless conversations with other families, we understand the deep concern parents feel about their child’s safety abroad.</p>
  <p>Students who grow up in Asia are often accustomed to safe, structured environments. In contrast, the U.S. presents unfamiliar risks — from gun violence to drug-related incidents — that are far less common in places like Taiwan, Korea, or Singapore.</p>
  <p>We recognize the anxiety that comes with sending your child overseas. That’s why we’ve built a trusted network and support system that families can rely on — offering peace of mind through local presence, cultural understanding, and real-time security expertise.</p>
